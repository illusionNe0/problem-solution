Knight Moves üêé
On an 8√ó8 chessboard, a knight is positioned at a given location. Write a program that marks the knight's position and all the squares it can attack. Mark the knight's position with the letter N and the squares it can attack with the symbol *. Fill all other squares with dots ..

Input Format:

The program receives the knight's position in chess notation (e.g., e4), where the first character represents the column (a-h, from left to right), and the second character represents the row (1-8, from bottom to top).

Output Format:

The program should print the chessboard, separating each element with spaces.

Sample Input 1:
b6
Sample Output 1:
